## My Lab

I love Linux. I use NixOS as my proper OS to work and probably I'll use it forever. I store my VMs, I play some videogames on steam with local and flatpak packages, I code and develop programs and packages as well (and still learning), I do my researches as well and I use it as whatever I want.) I chose NixOS cuz it gives me peace and control over my actions to the world
Also because I like control and privacy. I love setting things up in my ```/etc/nixos/configuration.nix``` file :)

My fav Linux distros of all time are NixOS, Arch and Debian
