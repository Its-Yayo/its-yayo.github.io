## Current Skills 
- Advanced Linux filesystem (I have a lot of experience with so many distros, Debian and Debian-based, Fedora and Fedora-based, Arch and Arch-based, Void Linux, Slackware, Alpine, FreeBSD, NixOS and soon Gentoo and LFS!)
- Virtualization (Type 1 (Proxmox, KVM), type 2 (vMware Workstation, Virtualbox))
- Conteinerization (Docker, Podman)
- Intermediate Server Management (I use RHEL 8.1 for my main server, Debian 11 for my little server and Alpine for my test server)
- Basic Bash Concepts (Shell and Scripting)
- Intermediate Python (Mainly for exploiting)
- Basic/Intermediate C/C++ (Mainly for vulnerabilities)
- Basic Rust (Mainly for Linux) 
- Backend Development
- Async Programming
- Clouding concepts (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS...)
- Networking concepts (OSI Model, Topology's Networks...)

## My Lab
I love Linux. I use my CachyOS with hyprland as my daily driver for everything and I'll use it forever. I just wanted to be different from I was before. I wanted to learn a new paradygma and I want to train my brain to learn new stuff (and to unlearn things as well). I do have my VMs with KVM/QEMU and also I do have some podman containers for specific purposes (for stability, I don't use my core system to test things). I want speed but also I want stability. I want peace but also I want freedom, and that's what my CachyOS has. For specific tasks in Windows I use a test laptop which has an unbloatwared Windows 10 22H2.
