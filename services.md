## Coding Classes (Basic - Intermediate)

On [contact](https://its-yayo.github.io/contact) you can check my timing stuff and you can [mail](mailto:yayitzz@proton.me) me (or dm me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/yayitzzz.bsky.social)) for any doubt you have, so we schedule a live 30 to 50-min meeting on Google Meet, Jitsi or Discord (Your choice). The topics we can encompass in pseudocode (or C++, Python or sample notes) are:
- Basic concepts (What's programming, introduction to programming languages, syntax's).
- Variables.
- Datatypes and Data Structures
- Operators
- Basic Algorithms 
- If Statements (If, if-else, else).
- Loop Statements (For, while, while-do).
- OOP (Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation).
- Exception Throws
- Basic low-level stuff (Memory allocation, pointers).
- Basic backend development concepts (HTTP methods, APIs, DBs, communication architectures). 
- Git (Version control system) and Github / Codeberg setup

Classes are only given in english and spanish. The cost of it will depend of the class's length and the difficulty of the doubt. Cost will round between $3 to $7 USD ($60 to $120 MXN) per class (meeting). I'll give yall fully details of my bank account. **For security reasons (in other words, for a scam protection lmao), you will need to pay me an advance of $3 USD ($60 MXN) before starting the class (meeting)**. We can schedule just a 30-min class for free if you want to see how my classes are given.

In case you are interested, **you need to schedule me with a 24h anticipation to prepare myself with a short presentation/notes.**
