### On-site / Virtual courses about privacy/security

For people who want to de-google and de-microsoft (and every other big tech company) themselves, I can help you. I teach people how to protect their data and how to be free in a digital ecosystem. If you are close on where I am, we can schedule an on-site 1-2h meeting so I will explain why this is so important for all of us. If not, we can schedule a meeting on Jitsi or Discord. I'm a human being that likes to talk to people so don't expect this course to be as a theorical course. I speak as my words pass by through my mind so in this case, I don't have a presentation for you so u can copy-paste it in your notebook. Take this as a chilled talk between 2 people about protecting their data. For the love of privacy/security I have, my first course will be for free and it will last 1 hr. If you want to keep chatting with me about this, costs will depend between $2 USD and $4 USD. 


### On-site / Virtual course about the importance of FOSS (free and open source software)

Same as my courses about privacy/security but in this case about the importance of having more FOSS (free and open source software). I believe that open source is the key of digital freedom. The importance of having open source software reveals how much you care about privacy/security and your support for niche projects. More details soon...


### Linux Installations

If you are new to Linux but you don't know where to start, I can help you. Doesn't matter if it's Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, etc... I can guide you every step on the way to install, configure and maintain your Linux system. Cost will depend on how much you want to dedicate to make your system stable. If you are close to me, we can schedule an on-site meeting (according to your needs up to my limits) and if not, a virtual meeting will be necessary (Virtual meetings will be slightly cheaper due of the distance to help remotely.). More details soon...


### Coding Classes (Basic - Intermediate)

On [contact](https://its-yayo.github.io/contact) you can check my timing stuff and you can [mail](mailto:yayitzz@proton.me) me (or dm me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/yayitzzz.bsky.social)) for any doubt you have, so we schedule a live 40 to 50-min meeting on Google Meet, Jitsi or Discord (Your choice). The topics we can encompass in pseudocode (or C++, Python or sample notes) are:
- Basic concepts (What's programming, introduction to programming languages, syntax's).
- Variables.
- Datatypes and Data Structures
- Operators
- If Statements (If, if-else, else).
- Loop Statements (For, while, while-do).
- OOP (Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation).
- Exception Throws
- Basic low-level stuff (Memory allocation, pointers).
- Basic backend development concepts (HTTP methods, APIs, DBs, communication architectures). 
- Git (Version control system) and Github / Codeberg setup

Classes are only given in english and spanish. The cost of it will depend of the class's length and the difficulty of the doubt. Cost will round between $3 to $7 USD ($60 to $120 MXN) per class (meeting). **For security reasons (in other words, for a scam protection lmao), you will need to pay me an advance of $3 USD ($60 MXN) before starting the class (meeting)**. We can schedule just a 30-min class for free if you want to see how my classes are given. In case you are interested, **you need to schedule me with a 24h anticipation to prepare myself with a short presentation/notes.**
