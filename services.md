## Services I mainly do in my spare time

I do offer some tech paid services. Check out my [contact](https://its-yayo.github.io/contact) page for more info so u can contact me in case you are interested so I can share with you more details about it (English and spanish only). Personally I do prefer Signal but it's your choice. 

- Basic / Intermediate Programming classes (Python / Pseudocode / DSAs)
- Linux / Unix Introductionary classes (Any distro tbh: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc, as well as the filesystem, initramfs...)
- Linux support (Patches, updates, cleanups, bug fixes...)*
- Windows support (Updates, bug fixes, cleanups...)*
- Basic backend apps and diagrams (I do mainly use FastAPI, Flask and Express.js)

(* This could be a regular montly lapse payment per hr of work since support requires me time to maintain your system at any time (except weekends unless if necessary))

If you need smth, don't doubt to reach me out in my contact page.
