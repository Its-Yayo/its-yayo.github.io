## Services I mainly do in my spare time

I do offer some tech paid services. Check out my [contact](https://its-yayo.github.io/contact) page for more info so u can contact me in case you are interested so I can share with you more details about it (English and spanish only). Personally I do prefer Signal but it's your choice. 

- Basic / Intermediate Programming classes (Python / Pseudocode / DSAs)
- Linux Introductionary classes (Any distro tbh: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc, as well as the filesystem, initramfs...)
- Linux support (Patches, updates, cleanups, bug fixes...)*
- Windows support (Updates, bug fixes, cleanups...)*
- Basic backend apps and diagrams (I do mainly use FastAPI, Flask and Express.js)

(* This could be a regular montly lapse payment since support requires me time to maintain your system at any time (except weekends unless if necessary))

## What don't I do?
- I don't exploit websites or kernel-based software
- I don't hack any social media, pls don't ask me to hack into your ex's instagram
- I don't teach people to hack or harm people 
- I don't fix printers lol

If you need smth, don't doubt to reach me out in my contact page.
