God Bless You

You need faith. You need to believe in something. Could be God or smth else (a book?, an art?, idk). Believing in something means that you are taking
off your back that burden you've been carrying for quite a lot of time. Burdens are not good my friend

I believe you need to dissapear and come back stronger. We are filled with internet drama, modern consumerism, toxic relationships and non-sense gossips. Society
is always looking for the most attractive and ephimeral way to satisfy their necessities and deep things don't matter anymore. We are filled with social media reels, drama, negativity, gossips
that people usually grant and applaud. People are choosing attractiveness, superficiality and attention rather than love, curiosity, deepness (I experienced that recently). 

Nowadays, schools are teaching 100 topics as fast as possible, prioritizing employment over curiosity. Dissapearing and building a purpose filled with love, discipline, faith and courage is gonna take you into the next level.
Going against the tide is gonna build you different, very different from what society expects from you. Its gonna leave you alone for a moment but this is when God comes out. God is never gonna leave
you alone. Never my friend

Maybe dissapearing is gonna allow you to connect with nature, with rivers, with the trees, with atoms, with the universe. Maybe someone could stay with you in that process, maybe not but in both contexts, you cannot lose your inner peace, you are
your first priority

You gotta believe, you gotta have faith. I know its difficult when you are a visionary and you have multiple projects in mind, but sometimes you feel you can't. I feel you, i know how it feels when
you've been working for a lot of time and it just simply doesn't works out. I wrote something about this more deeply in this [post](https://defcon.social/@yayitzzz/115486919167684988) if you wanna
read it. This little article is about having faith, about having faith in God, in the bible, in the quran if you want, idk. Smth. Just, believe. I know its difficult, but its necessary

Maybe you need a talisman. In my case, its Filion and Exion (my thinkpad and my gshock). Maybe you need a companion. Idk. Maybe you need to find your purpose. If you feel you are so tired of everything because you've
tried so many times, maybe its time to make a pause and ask yourself: "Why am I doing this in the first place?", maybe that's a tough question but its necessary.

Its hard to believe because its delegating some power to someone else you can't see. Maybe not, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Your eye has a maximum of 800 ppis, macroscopical. Microscopical things are always there, down at the
quantum level, there are some interesting things we don't know yet, but we already know that. How? Believing in that. Down at the quantum level, there are some things we can't see but that doesn't mean they don't exist. As simple as that

I know how it feels living in a world that usually feels 2 dimentions and you feel 6 or 7. Obviously you are going to be different because you a different and meaningful way to see how life works. You are hyper-activated because your
mind works in a different frequency. That's gonna hit you I know. It hit me and still. But hey, like I said, why are u doing what you are doing in the first place? Is it for someone (or smth)? Is it because you really want to help people and
society? Is it to impress a girl/boy? Is it because you are bored? Idk that's a question I give you for homework.

I believe you need to prioritize what's the best for yourself and leave room for other things if you can, but you cannot let yourself down because of external stuff. Paople may let you down, people may go away. But hey, do you wanna know who's not
going to leave you away? Yep, **you**. (And God knows that, He loves you so much).

Just have faith. I know its hard my friend, but do it. Act different, doesn't matter what society says about that. Go against the tide, build smth, write a line of code, donate money to organizations, help someine in a russian forum, study quantum mechanics, draw smth, meditate, pray
sleep, eat well, go for a walk, leave your phone for at least 4 hrs everyday and start observing the world. Take a deep breath and repeat this with me: "I am different, I can't be not different. I accept that and I'm going against the tide for a purpose.
Everything's gonna be alright"

> Ephesians 6:10-18: "Finally, be strong in the Lord and his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in this heavenly realms. Therefore, put full on the armor of God, so when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled arount your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people"

Amen

Amennnnnnnnnnnn :))
