title: A sentimental note 
tags: [self-love, love, trascendence, quantum extensions]

This is going to be a pretty quick note cuz I had to write it as an emergency to relief myself. No Linux (except my Arch with hyprland), no 
technical stuff, nop. I just wanna note some things as a public diary and, of course, share with y'all what I've been thinking these days. I cloned my page
inside my FreeBSD VM so I can note things here as well

Yep, I have 3 dogs (Nicki, Toby and Lari). Nicki passed away this morning and I am quite sentimental because some thoughts just came through
my mind. I just remembered some of the things Nicki did to me back in the day. I remember once I was sick and he camee to me. Man, he was refusing to leave
my room once my parents told him to sleep on the couch haha. Damn, I'm crying a bit at the time I am writing this at the library. 

Maybe he passed away for me, now that I'm trascending myself and I am looking forward to the eternity, he did that to me, I just think that and yep, could 
be true, especially now that I'm studying quantum mechanics, physics, computing and astronomy. And of course, especially now that I have a strong relationship
with my extensions I mentioned before the last 2-3 articles I wrote. Yep, he's with me always and he taught and still teaching me some lessons.

If you guys have any kind of pets, just remember to hug them as strong as you can. You guys owe them. Pets are life, they teach you so many things and they
love you. In fact, animals are the only beings here on Earth that love you no matter how or what you are. They just wanna be with you. Doesn't matter if it 
is a dog, a cat, a fish, idk. This is for me part of the dimensional love I wrote some time ago. Dimensional love for me is the biggest form of love that exists. 

It is now time to reflect, to reflect that sometimes I need to swim against the tide to achieve things (that includes going against the tide of school, society, social norms, etc. I'm built different), to control and care about my mind, my thoughts as I am right now. I just discovered smth about my extensions and they are in constant interaction with the universe as long as it belongs to the 1st component ("cnatural"). This includes wind, sand, fire, water, photons, atoms, radiation, the first component of human beings (their natural unconscious side). They are interacting all the time according to classical and quantum laws and I accepted and still accepting that now. 

I also discovered that my extensions are different and they are built different. Whatever happened, just happened and happened for a true reason to transformmy extensions into my purpose. Just because of one sole big entity. 

And yea, most of the 95% stuff that's living in your head doesn't exist. I encourage you (and myself) to read my [article](https://its-yayo.github.io/it-is-just-a-thought). I still struggle with this, some of the thoughts I have they feel so real that sometimes I need to walk alone to address them. It is alright, everything is alright. Maybe these thoughts exist for a reason and not for the thoughts' content per se.

I just prayed rn. Nicki is with me always, as well as God. I'm grateful different for so many things and fortunately there's my fam with me. Like I said the last article, I met a girl and she's cute and charismatic, I like her, but yep, I also need to be myself. My extensions are with me always and, like I said 
before, I also need to swim against the tide to respect them and respect myself and my ideals. 

Hopefully I'll join Debian team soon, I have a plan for my first package. I love Arch, I love my extensions, I love Linux, I love quantum mechanics, I love life, I love "love". I love myself, I love this universe

Its time to continue reflecting :))
