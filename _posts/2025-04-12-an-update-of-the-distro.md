title: An update of the distro
tags: [linux, gnu/linux]

Just a short message about an update about Xolo (the distro I'm building). There's no iso bootable for now but there will be one soon. 
The package manager will be extremely fast cuz it uses musl (alongside with Rust). Each package will be referenced as a .nop file (same as a 
.deb file with Debian, since the package manager will be named 'nopak'). I'll give more details about it prob these weeks/months. 

For mirrors, I'll use AWS instances while we (already stablished as a foundation) are looking for some physical servers around the world.

Now I'm learning Rust and C in a deep basis. I already know how to use pointers and emulate references in C and I'm studying ownerships 
in Rust (Chap. 4). These days I had a very huge mental breakdown but it's due of a personal change about freedom and privacy over mass
surveillance and society's views. I'll write a personal manifest about this soon!

For now, I'll began with the LFS distro starting out with [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) alongside with my journey with Rust. 

Also, if you are a geek and a curious guy like me and also u are learning Rust, reach me! we can learn together and who knows? i could not be the
only one building this thing

That's it for now, I'll just meditate a bit and then I'll continue working on this :)
