## Basics
I'm Yayo (or Yayitz). I'm a junior software developer and a computer science's student. Also, I'm a DevOps and DevSecOps enthusiastic. I like to build software, apps, etc. Also I love researching about the mind, how it works and how to control it. 

Im also a huge fan of open source and free software, I believe that quite changed my life to help others and myself with my special things and my special mind to build great stuff. 

Also I believe that security and privacy online (and offline) is one of the most important things I value. No one should ever track you, neither governments or companies or any other other mass surveillance. Try switching to startpage or nextcloud instead of other services. (Note, my page uses google fonts so I'd recommend you to block google's DNS for more privacy.)


## Hobbies
- I like (and started) to do researches and discoveries about the mind (neurology and pychoneuroimmunology) to modify it in a positive way on the trascendence of the human being (eternity) and to revert the well-said human deterioration. Also to know how to control my mind and my thoughts and actions.
- I love science, physics (classical and specially quantum), maths, computing science, whatever that trascends limits
- I like bowling and chess
- I like to listen to piano and reflective music for work.
- My first fav music genre of all time is phonk, it helps me a lot with motivation, discipline, coding, to be myself and **to build my purpose/eternity**. 
- My second fav music genre of all time is metal. It helps me to remind myself why I'm different. 
- I like to challenge myself with new challenges

## Favorite Quotes
- "And the end of the day, it's you and you. or, have you ever seen a group of eagles going for the same target?"
- "Talk is cheap. Show me the code"
- "That dream that you've holding in your mind, it's real"
- "When people say you can't do it, those people is showing you their limits, not yours"
- "It's very important for you to believe that you are the one"
- "The lifehack of a growing life is not seeing what didn't happen, but seeing what you did to make up for it"

Peace coding fellas :)
