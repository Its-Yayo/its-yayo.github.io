## Basics
I'm Yayo (or Yayitz or Y4y0) and welcome to my personal public space. I'm a CS student, a jr. software developer, FOSS  enthusiastic, jr. ethical hacker, "linuxero", internee quantum researcher and professional thinker lol. I do believe that open source and specially free software quite changed my life to help others and myself with my special things and my special mind to build great stuff for me and for society. Check out my [contact](https://its-yayo.github.com/contact) page

## Hobbies
- I like (and started) to do researches and discoveries about the mind (neurology and pychoneuroimmunology) to modify it in a positive way on the trascendence of the human being (eternity) and to revert the well-said human deterioration. Also to know how to control my mind and my thoughts and actions and also, to be eternal
- I love BSDs, Linux and Unix-like operating systems. I do like ricing as well, so I mainly test distros on VMs. My fav distros are Debian and Arch
- I love science, physics (classical and quantum), maths, computing science, whatever that trascends limits
- I like bowling and chess
- I like to listen to piano and reflective music for work. 
- I like to challenge myself with new challenges
- I usually meditate and do journaling mostly everyday

## Favorite Quotes
- "I cannot control the wind but I can with my sails"
- "And the end of the day, it's you and you. or, have you ever seen a group of eagles going for the same target?"
- "Talk is cheap. Show me the code"
- "That dream that you've holding in your mind, it's real"
- "When people say you can't do it, those people is showing you their limits, not yours"
- "It's very important for you to believe that you are the one"
- "The lifehack of a growing life is not seeing what didn't happen, but seeing what you did to make up for it"

Peace coding fellas :)
